      In crafting the Lights Out game for my final project, my focus was on creating a visually appealing and engaging user experience.
      I opted for a clean and centered layout with a light purple background, enhancing the aesthetic appeal.
      The modular structure of the code allowed for a systematic approach, separating concerns and promoting code maintainability.
      A key challenge was ensuring the random board generated was consistently solvable.
      To overcome this, I implemented a toggleSquares function that efficiently managed square states.
      The addition of a "New Game" button and move counter enriched the gameplay, providing users with a dynamic and interactive experience.
      Insights gained during this process included the importance of a thoughtful user interface, the significance of modularity in code organization, and the value of systematic problem-solving in game development.
      The final result is not only a functional Lights Out game but also a testament to the creativity and problem-solving involved in web development.
